# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:
# The include? method is called on the string "Hello World"
# One argument is passed ("Hello")
# The return is true

"Hello World".include?("Hello")

# The end_with? method is called on the string "Hello World"
# One argument is passed ("Hello")
# The return is false

"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")

# The method end_with? is called on the string ("Hello World")
# One argument is passed ("rld")
# The returbn is true

"Hello World".end_with?("rld")

# The even? method is called on to the integer 12
# No arguments are passed
# The return is true

12.even?


# The nest method is called on to the integer 18
# No arguments are passed
# The return is 19
18.next
